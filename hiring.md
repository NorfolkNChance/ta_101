Process:

# Step One: Initial contact

This can take several forms, from an unsolicited resume to a formal application based on a job post to a conversation with a valued former coworker.  




### Be prompt
No matter what kind of contact you're making, once somebody is waiting for your response you should make it a priority to respond promptly.  A quick no is kinder than a drawn-out maybe.  In particular, don't put off the no-thank-you responses because they are unpleasant:  dawdling on a likely candidate is risky for us, dawdling on somebody where the answer is quite clear is just rude.

### Be inclusive.  
At this phase in the relationship with a potential hire, we want to be opening doors rather than closing them.  If, for example, you get an email from a student who is interested in a TA job you should respond in a friendly, encouraging manner at this stage. 

In the opening phase of filling a position we want our filters to be wide open for two important reasons: first, this is a good antidote to the self-reinforcing effect of our own personal and professional networks; being receptive to new folks _even when we have doubts that they'll hit our hiring goals_ is a good idea because it forces us to engage with them as people not just as resumes.  It's a chance for us to listen for interesting perspectives or backgrounds we might not have considered in speccing our jobs.  

The other reason to be inclusive at this stage is to help the studio and the team project a positive, open-minded image to all potential hires.  That unqualified kid you have no room for today might come back three years from now as a rising star -- if you left a friendly, welcoming impression in your first contact you can be sure they will remember it.

### Turning a contact into a candidate

If an incoming resume or candidate looks promising this step is simple: 
* Make sure to that the candidate is in the applicants Trello
* Follow up to be sure the candidate knows we are actively reviewing their work
* **Promise they'll hear from us about a screening conversation by a certain date** Say something like "We'll contact you to arrange a meeting or phone call by [date].  If for some reason you don't hear from us, please contact me so I can see what went wrong".  It's surprisingly easy for somebody to fall from through the cracks, make a promise so we are held accountable.

### Saying No

Even if we approach hiring with an inclusive mindset, most contacts will still not be headed for a job.  If that's the case, here are some tips for saying 'No' in a way that is good for the company and for the candidate.

#### Be honest
Inclusivity does not mean stringing somebody along.  

If we are currently hiring for a senior position with steep tech requirements and the candidate is fresh out of school, it is not kind to pretend there's a job waiting for them.  You should explain the nature of what we have available and why it's not for them.  Try to phrase this as a statement of fact ("We're looking for somebody with XXX right now") and not as a criticism (NOT "We don't think you have what it takes").  It's useful to point at the language in the job descriptions on the website. 

Don't go into too much detail here: if you're offering a 'No' at this stage it should not be in a case where there's room for them to prove you wrong.  When rejecting, look for the obvious issues first: no relevant experience, clearly mistaken assumptions about the job on offer, or an obvious mismatch between their work samples and our needs.  If in doubt, let the contact flow through to the screening step, particularly if a candidate is coming from outside the traditional games industry talent pool.

#### Be polite

This should go without saying, but always be respectful.  Don't try to make a joke to lighten the situation -- jokes are an easy way to leave a wrong impression, even when they are meant as a softener. 

#### Be helpful
What you can do, very usefully, for candidates who don't have a realistic chance right now is to be helpful:
 * Explain how our hiring process works (that's what this doc is for: to help you have a good grasp of the process)
 * Provide feedback and suggestions about demo material. Most applicants will welcome constructive feedback about the presentation of the resumes and material.  Feedback on the CV or reel is a great way to show respect as well -- it lets the candidate know you've actually looked at their stuff.
 * Allow them to get your contact, encourage them to check back for new postings, and so on

If the applicants are particularly junior, you should also 
 * Point them at companies in the area who might have jobs at a more appropriate level
 * Encourage folks without local contacts to join the IGDA or any game-developer meetups in the local market
* Invite them to join TA communities like tech-artists.org or the GDC TA roundtables.


> Pro tip: It's a good idea to save your responses so that you have a template for common cases here. The most obvious cases for early rejection tend to be very junior people or people without relevant experience.  A small set of good letters, nicely done and sounding like a human being rather than a form letter, will make responding in a positive manner less onerous for you.  Trying to hand craft every response might incentivize you to put things off.


# Step Two: Screening

### Former colleagues
Once the candidate is on the Trello board, you should try to see if any of our teammates have worked with them before. Invite former colleagues to chime in on the Trello card (it's better on the card than in person, so we have a paper trail).  At this stage the positive recommendations matter less than any negatives: it will take serious consideration to overcome a disrecommendation. If a former colleague reports dangerous or unprofessional conduct, we'll need to issue a polite thank-you-no and move on. If disrecommendation is less extreme, it's a good idea to speak to the person about it to understand the context and severity of the problems. 

If the problem is serious then archive the card and issue the same polite no-thank-you you would for any candidate you're passing on.  You should never allude to the fact that someone here did not want to work with the candidate.  This is one case where a less than completely candid negative is justified: you can reply with a generic "thank you for your interest, we'll keep your application on file" without offering further contact -- you don't want to invite a followup conversation which might implicate an individual here.


### Portfolio review and tests

The next task is to try to be sure how well their CV, their experience and their portfolio really map onto what we are looking for.  

> We're still evolving a policy about this for tech art.  What follows are notes

#### Code samples
Github repos or similar code samples are an excellent places to get a sense of someone's technological scope. They only a sample of someone's range, so don't fixate on what the code _does_ or whether it's directly relevant to our job (if it is, that's great; if not that's not a ding). It's also important to pay attention to what kind of repo you're looking at -- we don't want to judge based on personal scratchpads, only on projects that reflect serious effort.


Here are things to look for in particular in code samples

 * **Experience level**  Look for clues which indicate the general level of coding experience.  For example, using C-style looping or lots of `elifs` instead of dictionary is usually indicative of limited python experience; list comprehensions as an alternative to manually assembled lists is solid mid-career style;  generator expressions and closures are often signals of advanced skills. 
 * **Profesionalism** Besides technical quality, does the code read well? Are functions and variables well named? Does the commit history in the repo include useful information? Would working with this code be a pleasure or a pain?  Try to look beyond superficial things like casing, tabs-vs-spaces, and the like and stress readability, clarity of intent, and good naming.
 * **Domain knowledge** If the code touches an area you know well, does it reflect best practices and current style? Or is it heavy on wheel-reinvention.

If the code raises more questions than it answers, try to clarify your questions in the phone or in person screening conversations.  Make sure you get the context, and whether the applicant thinks the piece that bothered you is their best work or if perhaps it's just a fluke.  Ask open ended questions like "I read you XXXX repo on Github, could you tell me a bit more about that project?" without indicating that you saw a problem -- you want to see the applicant's attitude without prompting a defense or an excuse.


#### Visual samples
The trick for us with visual samples is to make sure we're looking at the rignt things.  When we look at a rigging real, we want to look at the range-of-motion, deformations, and UX of the rig, not the character designs.  If we're evaluating a tools reel, try to spot the ergonomics in the demo more than the fancy QT style sheets or nice models.  

Unlike regular art reels, we're often more interested in the stories that accompany the visuals than the visuals themselves.  If the visuals don't speak for themselves, make notes to ask about in the screening conversation.

### Phones and in-person

There is a lot of room for error in verbal presentation on both side when we match a job description to a resume. Applicants are always of course trying to put their resumes into the best light, and our job descriptions are often imperfect representations of our real needs.  The screening step is ideally a conversation about the match between what we need and who the candidate is.  However there's a subtext in this conversation, which is that each side should be trying to convince the other that a hire would be a good idea.  

If possible, offer to meet the candidate in person.  You don't need to invite them to the office or get them to sign and NDA -- you can just meet for lunch nearby or have a sit-down after work. Phone screens are of course a good alternative if an in-person meeting is not possible, but most people do a better job of presenting themselves in person than over the phone so it's a kindness to make the time for an in-person meeting if possible.

If not, arrange a time and get a contact phone number to call. Send a text when you get the number to be sure you've got the right number. 

In either case -- use your phone calendar to make sure you don't let the time slip by.  If there's a scheduling problem, try to call and make your apologies ahead of time rather than after the face.  Do it by phone and not by text.

### Talking about the studio

It's a good idea to start the conversation by talking about us, rather than by peppering the candidate with screening questions.  

A quick introduction to the studio and our products is a good place to begin. "How much do you know about Undead Labs?" is a nice place to start since the answer will let you know what level of detail to offer in your overview -- a complete newcomer to the industry might not know us or our products while somebody with friends here won't need the whole history of us or the franchise. This question also gives a chance to see how much homework the candidate has done about us:  somebody who has clearly read up on us and our products is a more motivated candidate.

Depending on how much the candidate knows, give them a short description of who we are and what we do.  In addition to the basics (how many people, what projects, where we are located) we want to highlight positive things about the studio:
 * Good work-life balance
 * Collaborative environment
 * Almost 9 million players

We also want to talk briefly about our studio pillars.  "We're all adults here", "We get it done," and "We love games" (they are spelled out on [the jobs page](https://undeadlabs.com/jobs)) if you need a refresher.  This does not have to be a heavy duty sales pitch, but you do want to convey what's cool about the studio, the team, and the culture.   This part of the conversation doesn't have to be too long, 5 minutes or so should be enough to get your point across.  Do encourage questions, and keep an eye on what they are: that will give you valuable insights into where somebody's coming from.

### Talking about the position

The next topic is the position on offer. 

The bulletpointed version on the website ought to be a bit broader than the most concrete need; that's important to make sure we don't accidentally turn away a good candidate by overemphasizing a particular technical or career accomplishment.   However that also means you'll want to explain in more detail what our needs are and why we're hiring. You don't need to _repeat_ the words in the job listing, you want to _explain_ them.  Don't go into this conversation before you actually know what the position is really about. 

To set the context correctly right you'll need to talk about the project, at least in general terms.  At this stage the candidate is not under NDA so don't reveal anything proprietary, but give them enough information to know what we want them to do and why.

In this conversation you'll want to focus on the fundamental needs of the position what it does for the organization, not hard qualifications. That way a candidate who might not have the precise qualifications _you_ think are needed for the role may be able to tell you something that would make them seem like a viable candidate.  Don't fixate on a precise match for written specs: look for somebody who can help us solve the problem we're hiring to fix. Obviously there are going to be hard lines in here, you just want to find them in discussion rather than reading off a list.

### Evaluating

After you've laid out the position and the goals for the position, you want to start asking the candidate about how they'd contribute to doing that work. You don't have to force the issue, but it's often helpful to ask something like "Does this job seems like something you'd be well suited for?" or "does this sound like a job you'd like to do?"   

It's entirely possible the answer to the question is "no", in which case you should wrap the meeting up quickly and politely -- there's no obligation to drag it out if they aren't interested in what we're really looking for.  Thank them for their time, remind them they can always reach out to us again, and then go back to the candidate board and archive their card with a note explaining why the screen did not continue. You might want to ask if we could reword the job posting to make it clearer so that we don't have other people getting into the hopper with the wrong expectations of what we're offering.

If the candidate wants to go on, start asking how their experience would map onto the job you've described to them.  Here's where you want to switch over from leading the discussion to listening and prompting with questions.  There's a lot to learn from what they do and don't volunteer:  "I think I can do that" or "I'd be excited to work on that" are good positive responses, but "I think I'd handle that like.... " or "Have you tried ....?" are better -- they indicate somebody is engaging with the information you've given them and has relevant thoughts.  

**Don't try to trip people up or catch them in a mistake**: the goal in this conversation is to encourage the candidate to tell you why they think they're a good fit.  You want to probe for specifics: either experiences or personal qualities or philosophies that are relevant to the job at hand.  You want to ask fairly open questions and encourage them to talk -- you don't want to spend energy trying to trip them up or catch them in a mistake.  If somebody says something completely counterintuitive, probe gently at it without making a big deal: you want to be sure they didn't mis-speak and that you understood them.  You don't get any points for embarrassing someone.

As the conversation goes on, you'll want to start checking your reactions. Look for clarity in your own read of the situation: does this person seem like they merit an interview or not? Does the sum of their resume, experience, and this conversaion make them look like a viable candidate?  Interviews are a serious commitment for both Undead Labs and the candidate, so we don't want to do them unless we think there's a good chance the interview will result in a hire. 

As the conversation is reaching a conclusion, try to understand what the 'value proposition' a candidate offers really is, and ask questions to try out different versions of who they might be. For an enthusiastic person who is a little underqualified, try to find out other situations where they have demonstrated the ability to grow into a role.  For an experienced person doing something they've done before, try to see if they are comfortably professional or if they are just coasting.   

This part of the screen is unavoidably subjective, so you should beware of being too sure about your hunches. Make sure you're not making assumptions based on things like age, gender, a foreign accent, or anything else that's not part of the job. If you see a red flag you should not go out of your way to tell the candidate it's a problem, but you should ask confirming questions to make sure this really is a deficit in the candidate's profile and not an artifact of how something was said, or a product of your assumptions.

Sometimes a question will come up that's hard for you to answer. If it's an important question you may need to set up a followup call. 

In general, followup calls are only a good idea if they materially affect the likelihood of an interview -- either because a good candidate really wants a specific answer, or because the screener does not have information needed to make a definitive call.  A good example where a followup call is a good idea would be a female candidate who wants to ask some questions about what it's like to be a woman at Undead Labs which a male interviewer feels unable to address. On the other hand, promising a followup call because the candidate really wants to get into detail about a specific piece of software is only appropriate if the question is really mission-critical (say, a senior engineer who is very hostile to one piece of software or an artist who really wants to work with only one package).  

### Concluding the screen

By the end of the call you should have a pretty good idea if this candidate should or should not get an interview. However you should not promise them an interview explictly.  You should tell them what's going to happen next:
* We'll get in touch with you by a certain date (as with the first contact, if we don't get back to you by then please follow up).
* If we (not 'I') decide to take this to the next step, we'll arrange to bring you into the office for an interview.
* Typically an interview loop looks like this:
    [interview process description here; currently in flux]
* **If the conversation went well**,  make that clear and let the candidate know that you're excited about the possibility things will get to the next step.  Although we shouldn't _promise_ an interview it's good to communicate to a good candidate that we _really hope_ there will be an interview. You want to communicate that enthusiasm in case they find other prospects while we're deciding what to do about the interview loop. 
* Always conclude by thanking them for their time and interest in Undead Labs.  End every call, even ones you no will not result in an interview, on a polite and friendly note.


# Step Three : Interview or archive

Even though the screening conversation should always end without the promise of an interview, you should exit the screening conversation with a thumbs up or a thumbs down.  There is no "maybe".  

If you need time to think, use that time to write some notes that will help organize your thoughts.  If a little reflection does not turn the unknown answer to a yes, it's a no.  If you're on the fence about a candidate from one of our diversity target areas you might  err on the side of a yes instead -- but only if you're otherwise undecided.  Offering an interview to somebody who's unlikely to get the job is not doing them a favor.

Don't decline to recommend and interview because you think a better candidate is coming along. We don't want to lose a plausible candidate because there is somebody else out there: there is _always_ somebody else out there.  Ideally we should schedule interviews in close proximity so we don't leave interviewees hanging on the the results of other interviews:  we do want to be able to 'comparison shop' but we should try to do it in ways which are respectful of other people's time.

Once you've made up your mind, update the card with your notes. Make sure to headline the note with "Recommend Interview" or "Decline." If you're recommending an interview, add a timer to the card so we don't accidentally allow the date you promised in the call to slip by.

Sometimes time pressure or the flow of the conversation during the screen will leave some important questions open.  Ideally that won't be the case, but if it is make sure to make note of them as you update the card: if the interview sessions will need to resolve these questions later, make sure you record them right away so they are addressed during the interview.  If you're not the actual hiring manager on this screening call, you'll particularly want to bring those questions up so they are not forgotten.


# Step four: Interview prep

Once we've decided to bring in a candidate in, we should review the screener's notes to identify any lingering questions which we need to resolve in the interview.  We should also consider any issues what recommenders (or dis-recommenders) have noted and consider how we could get more information about them. 

There are some things we always want to know: 
* Is this person a good communicator? 
* Can they think on their feet? 
* Do they give evidence of a savvy development mindset? 
 
But most candidates will also have some specific question marks:  
* Are X's Python programming skills sufficient to the scale of the job we will be setting before them?  
* How much did Y contribute to that relevant system on their resume?  
* What was the special magic behind that impressive item on the demo reel (and is it really their work)?   

It would be a good idea for the screener to be present in the interview to make sure any lingering questions from the screen are addressed.  If that's impossible, make sure to hand the resolution of those questions off to somebody who will be in the interview.  Ideally do this in person rather than via email -- subjective questions about people are very hard to put well in email or slack.

# Step Five : Interview 

[TBD]

# Step 6: Wrapup
Once the interviews are complete, all the interviewers need to answer the survey and write up their feedback. Do this on your own -- we don't want people comparing notes until everyone has gotten their thoughts laid out in isolation.  

If the balance of responses is mostly negative, the hiring manager should just do a quick sanity check to make sure there are no biases at play and then get ready to close out the contact with the applicant.

If the balance is mostly or overwhelmingly positive, get the interviewers together to compare notes. The first order question is to turn a vague majority sentiment into a clear yes or no (again, there is no 'maybe').  The second order problem is to identify any issues the hiring manager will need to resolve -- tweaking the role so that the relationship starts out on the right foot, resolving expectations around things we do here, or addressing personal concerns like company policies that weren't resolved in the interview.
